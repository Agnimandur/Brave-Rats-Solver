Brave Rats is a 2 player imperfect information card game. Both players begin with 8 cards, numbered from 0 to 7. The goal is to collect 4 points via a series of *rounds*.

In each round, both players simultaneously play a single card from their hand. Generally, the higher card wins, and that player receives 1 point. Cards are discarded after use. If the card strengths are tied, the round is put on *hold*, and the next decisive round wins the round on hold as well.

Each card has a *special ability*:
* Musician (0) - The round is automatically put on hold.
* Princess (1) - If played versus the **Prince**, you automatically win the game.
* Spy (2) - Your opponent must reveal his next card.
* Assassin (3) - The *lowest* strength wins this trick.
* Ambassador (4) - If you win this trick, you win 2 points instead of 1.
* Wizard (5) - Your opponents ability is nullified this round.
* General (6) - In the next trick, your card gets +2 strength.
* Prince (7) - Immune to the **Assassin**.
